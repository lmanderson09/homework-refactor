# Horiseon Website - Code Refactor Project

---

As this website was initially presented it had few features that would allow easy accessibility to the disabled. I have updated several areas where I believe the improvements will enhance accessibility and provide a more enhanced user experience. This was a great project to test and improve upon html and css skills I am developing. In addition to providing a learning opportunity in basic coding, this was also an invaluable insight into the importance of developing websites and programs that are accessible by as many people as possible.

I owe a huge debt of gratitude for the assistance of my fantastic UNC tutor, Casey VanAlstyne for helping me through the many areas I got stuck and had questions on. I also would like to thank my lifetime mentor and son, Matthew Anderson for walking me through parts I was frustrated with but refusing to give me the answers. https://github.com/millerbyte, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFedSpsZDsuiAJ9HTD47Ksw/videos
